# Your-new-password-is-Incorrect-

Project description:

Creat an applicatrion used to generate a random password per the users specifications.

My code:

I coded the application in Java script by taking the same approach my group did for the Rock, Paper, Scissors game activity during class on November 16th and November 18th. I established a set of arrays, prompts and alerts to gather information from the user upon them clicking on the generate password button. Once the user clicks on the generate password button, they will answer a series of questions required to generate the password.

I ran into extreme difficulty when coding the for loop and pushing the code to password box. I re-watched both classes on November 16th & 18th, multiple videos on the web and even reached out to my class for assistance. While I have a better understanding I feel that I am still missing something. The loop will include one additional character than the user selected. Example: User selects password length of 8, the Java Script will push 9 to the password generator.
